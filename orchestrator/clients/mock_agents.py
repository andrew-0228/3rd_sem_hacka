"""
Mock Agent/Market Engine — stands in for Person 2's service.

Implements the same interface Person 2's real service will expose:
  - get_offers(grid_state, requests) -> list[AgentOffer]
  - clear_market(offers) -> list[ProposedAction]

Includes a scripted hospital-battery rejection so the "safety-aware"
demo beat works even before Person 2's real agent logic exists.
